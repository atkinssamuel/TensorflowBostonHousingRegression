# Boston Housing Regression:
In this repository, a simple Tensorflow model was created using Tensorflow 1.14.0. This model was applied to a relatively small Keras dataset. I tackled this project to enhance my versatility with respect to the platforms that I use to analyze data. This repository will serve as a benchmark for future data analysis projects. The training and testing functions are easy to replicate. 

## Results:
